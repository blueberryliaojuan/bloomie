## Challenges and what I Learned:

1. It took me some time to get used the tailwind, as I did not use it before. I tried to use customised css variables but failed to use className like "color-primary", then I used inline style instead
   (eg. {
   color: favorite ? "var(--primary-color)" : "var(--secondary-color)",
   })
2. I learned that the higher verion of react-router-dom uses RouterProvider, so I tried in this project
3. learned about the way to use ionIcons in the react, I made some mistakes on how to import css, finally found that I can use them as components, like <IonIcon icon={heartOutline} className="text-lg" />
4. the state management of react is very similar to Vue, so I got used to it quickly
5. I used JSON server to store my data
